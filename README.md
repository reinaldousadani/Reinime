# Lessons learned while building this project

### - I really need to learn Typescript

### - Object mutations are bad. And avoid passing objects(references) as a function parameter

### - Try to make functions with no side-effect unless you really need to

### - Try to make a completely reusable modal using createPortal

### - Try to make a component really reusable without any dependencies

### - Apollo Client and emotion(styled-components) are awesome.

### - GraphQL > REST

### - Do not overuse context. Use it only for datas that are needed across the whole App.

### - Skeletons are better than spinners...
